# Sentiment and Technical Analysis Trading System

This repository contains code and resources for a sentiment and technical analysis trading system. The system combines sentiment analysis techniques with technical analysis indicators to generate intraday trading signals. It leverages various libraries and algorithms to collect, analyze, and process sentiment data from multiple sources, including Twitter, Stocktwits, Reddit, Telegram, and news headlines from Yahoo and Interactive Brokers. The system also utilizes technical analysis libraries such as TA-Lib for feature engineering and generating trading signals for swing trading and scalping strategies.

## Features

- Perform sentiment analysis using Flair, Hugging Face, and Transformers on real-time data from various sources.
- Collect sentiment data from Twitter, Stocktwits, Reddit, Telegram, and news headlines.
- Implement algorithms for data retrieval and processing from these sources to enable real-time sentiment analysis.
- Utilize TA-Lib library for technical analysis and feature engineering.
- Generate trading signals based on a combination of sentiment analysis and technical analysis indicators.
- Develop custom logic to enhance and adapt trading signals generated by TA-Lib to specific trading styles and preferences.
- Conduct extensive research and experimentation to identify the most effective combination of sentiment analysis tools, technical indicators, and custom logic for accurate trading signals.
- Implement data processing and signal generation algorithms to efficiently handle large volumes of data and enable real-time updates.
- Maintain a systematic approach to backtesting and validate the performance of trading signals generated by sentiment and technical analysis components.
- Collaborate with team members to fine-tune and optimize algorithms, incorporating feedback and insights to improve accuracy and effectiveness.
- Document methodologies, algorithms, and performance results for transparency and reproducibility.
