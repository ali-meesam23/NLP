Performed sentiment study for intraday trading signals using Flair, Hugging Face, and Transformers. Collected and analyzed sentiment data from various sources including Twitter, Stocktwits, Reddit, Telegram, and news headlines from Yahoo and Interactive Brokers.
Implemented algorithms to pull and process data algorithmically from these sources for sentiment analysis in real-time.
Utilized technical analysis libraries such as TA-Lib to perform feature engineering and generate trading signals for swing trading and scalping strategies.
Developed custom logic to enhance the trading signals generated by TA-Lib and adapt them to specific trading styles and preferences.
Combined sentiment analysis and technical analysis signals to make informed trading decisions and optimize trading strategies.
Conducted thorough research and experimentation to identify the most effective combination of sentiment analysis tools, technical indicators, and custom logic for generating accurate trading signals.
Implemented data processing and signal generation algorithms to handle large volumes of data efficiently and enable real-time trading signal updates.
Maintained a systematic approach to backtesting and validating the performance of the trading signals generated by the sentiment analysis and technical analysis components.
Collaborated with team members to fine-tune and optimize the algorithms, incorporating feedback and insights to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the trading signals.
Documented the methodologies, algorithms, and performance results of the sentiment analysis and technical analysis components for transparency and reproducibility.
